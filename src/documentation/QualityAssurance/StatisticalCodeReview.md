## Introduction

____

Statistical code review is a method of evaluating the quality of code by analyzing the statistical properties of the codebase. It involves the use of various metrics and tools to identify potential issues and areas for improvement. By analyzing the statistical properties of the code, developers can gain insights into the complexity, maintainability, and overall quality of the codebase.

## Implementation in EasyBank

____

In the EasyBank application, statistical code review is performed using static code analysis tools such as SonarLint and SonarCloud. These tools analyze the codebase and provide feedback on code quality, security vulnerabilities, and potential bugs. By using statistical code review tools, the development team can identify and address issues early in the development process, leading to a more robust and maintainable codebase.
